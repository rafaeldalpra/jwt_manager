Manages encoding/decoding of any payload data
You can dynamically refer to the key used to encode/decode through the use of 'secret_key_env_variable_name'

Usage:
```manager = JwtManager.new('INTEGRATION_JWT_TOKEN')`
payload = { a: 1, b: 2 }
token = manager.encode(payload)
=> encoded token```

```decoded token = manager.decode(token)
=> decoded token, find original payload here
```
